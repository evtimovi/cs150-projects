# cs150-projects
A repo containing my projectwork from Data Structures and Algorithms (CS 150 @ Lafayette College)

Project 1's goal was to simulate the evacuation of a building and time it when varying the number of people on each floor and the number of staircases.

Project 2's goal was to build a database of restaurants that could be queried and filtered based on rating, location, and other attributes.

Project 3 focused on simulating a delivery network with warehouses and stores that needed delivery. We were tasked with approximating a "best delivery route" given truck constraints (distance and load).
