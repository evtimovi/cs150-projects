/**
 * This class is my own implementation of an Undirected Graph completed according
 * to the assignment for lab 10. It implements a generic undirected graph where
 * the type of the key and the value of the element related to that key can be
 * specified as type parameters. 
 * The class makes use of an inner node class that stores the different
 * elements and is characterized by a key. No repetition of the keys is allowed,
 * but this ensures that the elements stored in the graph can be repeated.
 * The graph implements the addNode and addEdge methods and the constructor initializes
 * an empty graph.
 * 
 * Moreover, the class has two inner classes - UnDirectedGraphNode and UnDirectedGraphEdge
 * that help in the construction of the graph.
