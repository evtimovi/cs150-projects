My main class is the MovieIo class. It has methods to read and write the data appropriately.
My container classes are TitleComparatorTreeSet and DirectorComparatorTreeSet.
My comparator classes are the DirectorComparator and the TitleComparator.
Where appropriate, they also have test classes. However, the container classes are not unit-tested
since they have only get methods. The same goes for the Movie class.
The file inputDatabase.txt is my input file and the results of two runs of my program have been saved in file1.txt (TitleComparator),
file2.txt (DirectorComparator), file3.txt(TitleComparator) and file4.txt(DirectorComparator).
emptyFile.txt, wrongPattern.txt, output1.txt, output2.txt, outputOfTest.txt, outputOfTest2_correct.txt, and outputOfTest3.txt
are all files used for the unit-testing of MovieIO.
Please, note that I have found that the Windows text editor ignores the characters for new lines so that the .txt file
appears as a single line if opened on a PC. However, the text editor on the lab computers displays the text properly and the
program, which uses nextLine() and hasNextLine() methods of the Scanner class, runs properly under Windows as well.
